# Specification Quality Checklist: High-Frequency Market Making System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Planning Phase Completion

- [x] Research document created with all technical decisions
- [x] Data model defined with all entities and relationships
- [x] API contracts created for exchange and strategy interfaces
- [x] Quickstart guide created with installation and usage instructions
- [x] Agent context updated with new technology stack

## Notes

- All requirements have been clarified and the specification is ready for implementation
- Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) are complete
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Implementation Tasks) with `/speckit.tasks` command
